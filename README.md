# Bidimensional_Laplace_Equation
Grapher software able to show the distribution of Electric potential in a two dimensional surface, by solving the Laplace equation with a discrete method. This project has been developed in MatLab and it´s tool, App Designer. The final result allows to show the distribution of the electric potential produced by an specific geometric configuration: a square shell with a triangular, circular an square equipotential surface. Finally, this program can be considered as a multi-solver of the Laplace equation because of it´s capacity of being extrapolated to other areas.
